## **[GROUP WORK] Projet step 01: descriptive stats and data cleaning**

In order to prepare the data science project that will need to complete, gather in project group and answer the following questions:

The project will use the `california_houses.csv`.
In this dataset, **each row of the dataset represents one district in California**.


 - Load the dataset
 - For **each** column, print out descriptive statistics (including distributions, etc.) that you find relevant to get to know the data
 - Identify and fix issues in the dataset (spoiler alert: there are many!)
 - Create a categorical  variable \<Closest_city> indicating the closest CA city and drop the distance to each city (not needed)
 - Describe **each** column with a descriptive sentence
 - Save your clean dataset as a csv file
 - Using a library such as `geopandas` or `plotly`, plot the location of districts on a map
 - Using the function you wrote in the first two sessions, perform a descriptive analysis of each variable independently.
