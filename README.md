About this project:
This is a data science group project. The dataset used is the dataset of California house values which is very well known in ML field. Separately, data cleaning, data mining, and house value prediction model construction and model evaluation were performed. The aim is to train python programming skills and to understand and familiarize with the use of packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Sklearn.
